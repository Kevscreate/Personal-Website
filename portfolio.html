                    Continuing with the path of tech, and saying I would like to leave a trace of myself and work on the web. I wanted to create some sort of website or game. I started one about a few months ago when I was diving into the subject.
                    <img class="img" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1450/2812/files/IMG_7405_2_1024x1024.jpg?v=1690249753">
                <p>
                    
                    I enjoyed learning and constructing things so I decided to do a subject I'm most passionate about, which is cars. I love all types of cars from old to new so I decided to make a project page about my car. I was going to make it a list of things I wanted to add to it to make it fun and cool. Although I never got to finish and barely started it, I might continue on it since I know more now.
