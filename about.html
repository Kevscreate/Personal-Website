                    <p>I'm a 2000's baby so I've grown up with the ever expanding and growing pace of technology. I've never let myself go from reality though, I always went out and spent time with friends and played some sports.
                    </p>
                    <p> I've always been fascinated with technology and how it functions and it transfering from a machine to a screen producing   scenery. Now the world is still producing fascinating tech like Apples Virtual Reality which shows tabs of your favorite streaming service float in your face and be interactive.
                    </p>
                      It's super cool and I'm looking forward for something that revolutionizes the world and helps it for the better.

                    <p>Gaming is like basically like any other persons favorite activity to pass the time, an escape from reality! I'm now starting to go more into the IT route and I think it would be pretty cool to be a part of the web, leaving my markings and work along the way.

                    As anyone, being a part of something is a very good feeling in your core. I'm happy I got to grow up with the advancement of technology because I saw the massive progress and advances of tech. I'm also glad I haven't lost my love for gaming as I still am a heavy gamer. Streaming is something I am interested in as well but we'll see if life has room for me to do that haha.

                    I graduated from High School not to long ago and I was pretty active in sports. Anything doing with running got my attention and got me fired up. I enjoyed playing a variety of sports, games, or 5K run. My school had a tradition of running a 5K run around school campus and I loved being competitive against my friends. 
                    <p>Although I enjoy playing sports, for the life of me, I cannot play them at all. I will always try my best but when I know I drag the team down or make us have a disadvantage, I always look for other ways on helping.

                    Soccer and football were the sports I mainly played and a bit of batminton for a while. I liked to take pride in my foot work and ability to be hard to drop on the floor. I was and still am a stubborn guy when it comes to competitive sports.

                    <p>I try my best to help others and give others a chance to shoot their shot and practice. I'm always aware of balance and I try my best to equal out the field when I could and at times take charge.
